# My Portfolio Website

This is just a showcase of some professional projects I have helped develop.

# How it's made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, Typescript, React/Vite

Starting with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) as the framework, I built out a simple website using HTML and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and styled and accounted for responsive design with vanilla [CSS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/). Used [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for icons, as well as [react-responsive-carousel](https://github.com/leandrowd/react-responsive-carousel) for the project screenshot carousel. page routing done with [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

#Lessons Learned:

Vite is very quick and snappy in comparison to [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). There is still interesting nuances in setting up the config file in vite, but there are plenty of resources to help implement js modules and the like.

## How to run the website locally:
in the root directory, run `npm install && npm run dev`

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
